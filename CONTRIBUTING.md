# Contributing to Yardland

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/EliotVonEcklie/libyardland/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/EliotVonEcklie/libyardland/issues/new?assignees=EliotVonEcklie&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
  - Give details about your environment
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- We recommend using Stroustrup identation for the C++ Code.
- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification.

## Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
  - :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
  - :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
  - :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
  - :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
  - :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
  - :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
  - :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  - :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
  - :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  - :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
  - :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings
